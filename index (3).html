        <h1>Title</h1>
        <p>Our mission is to prevent the food wastage and utilize the food before decaying in an efficient way through our website “ORPHOFOODS”. An overview on how the module works is given, including descriptions, use-cases, database models, activity diagrams, and in more detail an elaboration on the inner workings of the algorithm behind the orphofoods. Our ultimate goal is not just to minimize food wastage, but also to make people aware of the large implications of waste management. When it comes to making big changes, small steps are everything.  <br>
	ORPHOFOODS is a website which provides platform for the sender who sends food and the receiver who receives food. The requirement of the application is to provide the details mainly about the various organizations, hostels, orphanages and hotels. If there is any leftover food which is of no use, the sender can make update on our site about the food, so that the organizations near the sender zone can collect the food.</p>

        <h1>Food wastage</h1>
        <p>      Food waste or food loss is food that is discarded or lost uneaten. The causes of food waste or loss are numerous, and occur at the stages of production, processing, retailing and consumption.
      Global food loss and waste amounts to between one-third and one-half of all food produced. Loss and wastage occurs at all stages of the food supply chain or value chain. In low-income countries, most loss occurs during production, while in developed countries much food – about 100 kilograms (220lb) per person per year – is wasted at the consumption stage.
